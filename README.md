# 💧 Water Tank ADT (CCE105L) 
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a water tank abstract data type (ADT) in Java. It simulates real-world water tank operations such as filling, draining, checking capacity, and tracking history.

# 📌 Features
 - Fill the tank with a user-specified amount of water.
 - Drain the tank safely, preventing underflow.
 - Check the current water level at any time.
 - Automatic overflow/empty checks to prevent invalid operations.
 - View the history of all fill and drain actions.
 - Constraint: Tank has a maximum capacity of 100,000 gallons.
